In your own words, briefly explain the purpose of the experiments and the experimental setup. 
	Be sure to clearly state on which machine you ran the experiments, and exactly what 
	your command line arguments were, so that we can reproduce your work in case of any confusion.
Very carefully describe the custom page replacement algorithm that you have invented. Make sure to 
	give enough detail that someone else could reproduce your algorithm, even without your code.
Measure and graph the number of page faults, disk reads, and disk writes for each program and each page 
	replacement algorithm using 100 pages and a varying number of frames between 1 and 100. Spend 
	some time to make sure that your graphs are nicely laid out, correctly labelled, and easy to read.
Explain the nature of the results. If one algorithm performs better than another under certain conditions, 
	then point that out, explain the conditions, and explain why it performs better.
